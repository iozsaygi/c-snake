# Classic Snake

Grid-based snake game, which was created during a small Saturday (March 2, 2025) game development challenge within
several hours. I used MinGW to compile this for Windows, but it should require minimal effort to port this to other
compilers, such as MSVC.

This is also possible thanks to a
wonderful [lecture](https://www.kosbie.net/cmu/fall-10/15-110/handouts/snake/snake.html#:~:text=In%20the%20game%20of%20Snake,as%20possible%20before%20that%20happens.)
that is available on the internet, which explains the details of the grid-based snake game amazingly.
